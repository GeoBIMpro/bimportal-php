The BIMportal, LAMP

http://youtu.be/dNUFRohKjM8


Application written for a client that we have decide to opensource for others to use.


What:

The BIMportal is a collaborative working tool for multiple stakeholder engagement on a BIM project. The case was proposed by an old client whereby we would do BIM related processes as a service and allow them to access results through our servers. The application was designed and built as a set of smaller applications. Framework used was CakePHP.

Below is a list of the applications and their discriptions. Please dont hesitate to contact us for any further information.

-clash detection(issues): complete clashes using navisworks and parse output to webpage.

-3D model viewer application: Via catenda BIMsync API version 1.0.0 Contact them for model hosting service and access keys.(LINK)

-Document viewer: using CadSoft tools. Contact them for access keys. (LINK)




Todo: 

-Remove branding
-further testing
